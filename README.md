# SentinelCloud: Automated DDoS Protection & Recovery

## Problem Statement ID: 1649
### Ministry of Defence - DRDO | Smart India Hackathon 2024

## üõ°Ô∏è Project Overview
**SentinelCloud** is a cutting-edge solution developed to safeguard cloud-based infrastructure from **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)** attacks. As DDoS attacks evolve, they become increasingly complex and devastating, especially for organizations relying on cloud services. **SentinelCloud** combines real-time detection, mitigation, and automatic recovery to maintain high availability and ensure service continuity, even during sophisticated DDoS attacks.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Description
The key objectives of this project are:
- **Cloud Architecture**: Design a robust cloud architecture to host web applications and services that ensures **high availability** while minimizing downtime during an attack.
- **DDoS Detection**: Develop a set of security tools that can automatically detect and mitigate **DDoS attacks** based on traffic analysis and anomaly detection.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Implement analytics to identify patterns of suspicious behavior:
  1. High traffic originating from a single IP or IP range.
  2. Flood of requests from users with similar profiles (device type, location, etc.).
  3. Surge in requests to specific endpoints/pages.
  4. Unusual traffic spikes, such as periodic surges.
- **Automated Recovery**: Provide seamless recovery from DDoS attacks, reducing downtime to the minimum.
- **DDoS Attack Mitigation**: Integrate advanced tools that can mitigate the attack by throttling malicious traffic and rerouting legitimate requests.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Uses machine learning algorithms to detect suspicious traffic patterns and immediately identify DDoS attacks.
- **Automated Mitigation**: Redirects and blocks malicious traffic to prevent service downtime.
- **Cloud Architecture**: Highly scalable and resilient cloud infrastructure for hosting websites and services, ensuring continuous service availability.
- **Attack Simulation**: Tools to simulate various types of DDoS attacks to test resilience.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Provides detailed traffic analysis, attack patterns, and post-attack recovery insights.
- **Automatic Recovery**: Fast recovery mechanisms to restore normal service post-attack with minimal downtime.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS / Google Cloud / Microsoft Azure
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow / PyTorch for attack detection.
- **Traffic Analysis**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for monitoring and analyzing traffic.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: For blocking malicious requests.
- **Load Balancers**: For distributing traffic and ensuring high availability.
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: Containerized deployment for scalability and resilience.
- **Blockchain** (Optional): To verify the integrity of the cloud infrastructure.
- **Python**: For implementing detection algorithms and mitigation strategies.

## üìã System Architecture

### Cloud Architecture:
1. **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
2. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Filters and blocks harmful traffic patterns.
3. **DDoS Detection System**: Analyzes traffic and flags suspicious activities.
4. **Mitigation System**: Automatically responds to DDoS attacks by blocking malicious IPs or redirecting traffic.
5. **Backup Servers & Auto-Scaling**: Automatically scale the number of active servers to handle traffic spikes.
6. **Recovery Tools**: Automatic fallback and service recovery after attack mitigation.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   \`\`\`
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentinelcloud.git
   cd sentinelcloud
   \`\`\`

2. **Deploy Infrastructure**:
   - Setup cloud infrastructure using **Terraform** or manual cloud configuration in AWS/Azure/Google Cloud.
   - Deploy the **Docker containers** for WAF and detection systems.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install required Python libraries for DDoS detection:
   \`\`\`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   \`\`\`

4. **Configure**:
   - Modify the \`config.yml\` file with your cloud details and traffic thresholds.

5. **Run the DDoS Detection System**:
   - Start monitoring traffic and detect attacks:
   \`\`\`
   python ddos_detection.py
   \`\`\`

6. **Simulate a DDoS Attack** (for testing):
   - Use the provided DDoS simulation tool to generate attack traffic and observe mitigation:
   \`\`\`
   python ddos_simulator.py
   \`\`\`
